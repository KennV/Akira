# Akira; A Technology Test of SwiftData and SwiftUI
### Or; "How I stopped worrying and learned to love the Bomb"

Now I have added a basic implementation of SwiftData; It took a lot less time than it did going along with the YouTube Contend _However_ because I also refactored the names of the files inline it took longer than it will next time.
Still this is a vast improvement over;
1. >Doing it in XIB Files Top-Down with Dummy Data
2. >Adding persistence in JSON

SO I have started from an Empty Repo that I scavanged from Github and had no project in it, it had my boilerplate ./.gitignore but not even this ReadMe.md

After Setting up a Blank iOS template I will add a few Droovy Directories for Resources, DataControllers and Views plus other DataEditors:UIView, possibly even a stub directory for external libs but that is getting ahead of things

So I really have an affinity for Cocoa and CoreData. Hell I was even starting to like working with UIKit and these Dynamic Layouts and such. ~However my unit from ALL of my previous labs was KIA with all of my data and its replacement was both balky and unsuppoted/non-upgradeable {*yay*}.

Therefore if I would be starting from a relatively clean slate then it stands to reason that I should be willing and able to create an App using these two Key Technologies.
